# Deep Generative Models â€“ Final Project (BIU, 2025)
This repository contains the code for the final project of the `Deep Generative Models` course, taught by `Dr. Ethan Fetaya` at `Bar-Ilan University` (2025).

The project explores how `State Space Models` (SSMs) handle large-context inputs and compares their performance to `Large Language Models` (LLMs), building upon the findings from the `Lost in the Middle` paper (see full citation at the `References` section).

## References

This project builds upon the findings from the paper `Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts`. We extend this work by applying similar methodologies to State Space Models (SSMs), investigating how they handle large-context inputs compared to Large Language Models (LLMs).

Portions of this code are based on the original implementation from Lost in the Middle, licensed under the MIT License. Additional contributions have been made by Gal Sarid (2025).
