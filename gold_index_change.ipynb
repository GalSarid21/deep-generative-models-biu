In prokaryotes, ATP synthase is located in the plasma membrane, where it uses the proton gradient across the membrane to synthesize ATP.',\n",

Elevators often use a system similar to an Atwood machine, where a counterweight is used to balance the weight of the elevator cab and its passengers. This counterweight helps reduce the energy consumption of the elevator motor, as it only needs to overcome the difference in weight between the cab and the counterweight, rather than lifting the full weight of the cab alone. This makes the elevator system more efficient and reduces the load on the motor, which can lead to cost savings and improved performance',\n",
